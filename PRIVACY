auto-labeler is a command line tool that runs on your computer and automatically labels data
based on how you've labeled emails in the past. In order to do this, it needs access to the
following Gmail permissions:

- The permission to read labels in your Gmail account in order to lookup label metadata

- The permission to read and modify emails in your Gmail account in order to train a
  model, classify incoming emails, and automatically add or remove labels to your
  emails

The data auto-labeler accesses from Gmail is never stored or shared with any other app.

auto-labeler's use of data received from Google APIs adheres to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes),
including the Limited Use requirements.
