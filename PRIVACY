auto-labeler is a command line tool that runs on your computer. All the data auto-labeler that it
accesses never leaves the computer that it is run on. auto-labeler reads the contents of emails in
order to train a model as well as automatically label incoming messages. The contents of the
emails are never stored.

auto-labeler's use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the Limited Use requirements.
